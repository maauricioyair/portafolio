This collaborative approach has enriched my experience, giving me a deep understanding of teamwork dynamics and the importance of effective communication to achieve outstanding results.</p><p class='markBracket'>In addition, I have a passion for continuous learning and exploring new technologies. In my free time, I enjoy spending hours studying and experimenting with the latest tools and frameworks such as React.js, MongoDB, Node.js and currently Astro.build.
