  "ABOUT": "<p>I started my adventure with WordPress. While working with WordPress requires knowledge of PHP and MySQL, you could say that I worked as a Full Stack Jr. But my main focus is the Front-end in JavaScript. But I don't rule out further training on the Back-end. During this time, I have actively participated in various projects, playing an important role in the creation of custom themes, plugins and optimization of websites, until their successful launch to production.</p><p>My professional background has allowed me to collaborate closely with multidisciplinary teams, including designers, developers, clients and project managers. This collaborative approach has enriched my experience, giving me a deep understanding of teamwork dynamics and the importance of effective communication to achieve outstanding results.</p><p>In addition, I have a passion for continuous learning and exploring new technologies. In my free time, I enjoy spending hours studying and experimenting with the latest tools and frameworks in the Web Development field. This curiosity and commitment to constant improvement has allowed me to keep up to date with new trends.</p>"
